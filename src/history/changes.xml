	<release version="0.22">
		<change>Small performance improvement in init(Writer,String)
		and reset() methods.  Instead of creating a java.util.Stack
		instance (to contain the open elements), the clear() method is
		called on the existing Stack instance. Also made the field
		final. This could improve the performance slightly as
		well.</change>
		<change>Removed unused state VOID_WITHIN_ELEMENT.</change>
		<change>Allowing empty CDATA sections and empty
		comments.</change>
		<change>Internally using a String array instead of a Stack to
		keep track of the open elements. This should improve
		performance.</change>
		<change>Added method: String[] getElementStack().
		<change>Added method getElementStackSize() as a replacement
		for getDepth(). Deprecated getDepth().</change>
		<change>Added setState(State,String[]) and deprecated
		setState(State).</change>
