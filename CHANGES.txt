______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.52:

* Generated package now has the prefix .tgz instead of .tar.gz.

* The tests are now included in the package.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.51:

* Added a parameter to the text(Writer, char) method in XMLEncoder to
  indicate if the ampersands should be escaped. The old method has been
  deprecated.

* Fixed: the text(Writer, char) method in XMLEncoder now correctly escapes the
  characters and throws an InvalidXMLException if a character is not valid.

* Improved performance and reduced size of the methods
  attribute(Writer, String, String, char, boolean) and
  and text(Writer, char[], int, int, boolean).

* Added more unit tests for the PCDATA section.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.50:

* Changed e-mail address from znerd@FreeBSD.org to wfe.dehaan@gmail.com.

* No longer including the version in the package description.

* Fixed a bug in the XMLEncoder introduced in xmlenc 0.47. Added a unit test
  for it. The bug was discovered by Tauseef Rehman and Anthony Goubard.
  Rolled back the implementation of the method
  attribute(Writer,String,String,char,boolean) in class XMLEncoder to the one
  that was in revision 1.206 of the file.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.49:

* Extended tests for indentations and line breaks. Improved related code. Now
  a line break must first be set before an indentation can be set. Also, an
  indentation must only contain spaces and/or horizontal tab characters.
  Unsetting the line break now automatically resets the indentation. Fixed a
  number of bugs that caused unproper output when using indentation.

* Now checking the format of SystemID and PublicID in
  dtd(String,String,String).

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.48:

* Fixed SF.net bug #1242439. A bug in the IBM JDK 1.3 was causing
  NoSuchFieldErrors. This has now been worked around.

* Disabled optimization in javac to enable line numbers in stack traces.

* Improved performance tests. Results are now net instead of gross.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.47:

* Improved the performance of the XMLEncoder.

* Introduced performance tests. Execute with 'ant perftests'.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.46:

* Removed UnicodeXMLEncoder and SevenBitEncoder. The code has been moved to
  XMLEncoder.
  Typical impact on performance: Medium.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.45:

* Performance-optimized the text and attribute methods in the XMLOutputter
  class.

* Added an abtract method shouldEscape() to the XMLOutputter.

* The method text(Write,char) is now implemented in the XMLOutputter.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.44:

* Fixed bug in XMLEncoder.text(Writer,char[],int,int,boolean). This
  method would not output all characters if the specified start index was
  greater than 0. This was reported by Mark Frost.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.43:

* Fixed bug in XMLEncoder that effectively caused escaping to be always on,
  instead of configurable using setEscaping() in XMLOutputter and using the
  escapeAmpersands argument in the text(...) methods in XMLEncoder. This was
  reported by David Fogel.

* Improved documentation of escapeAmpersands argument in the text(...) methods
  in class XMLEncoder. This was suggested by David Fogel.

* Fixed typo in Javadoc comment for method declaration() in class
  XMLOutputter. Reported by Jan Willem Borleffs.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.42:

* Some performance improvements. Suggested by Christian Ullenboom.

* Fixed bug in text(Writer,char[],int,int,boolean). This bug caused the method
  to behave erroneous if start is not 0 and escapeAmpersands is false. It
  would write the complete character string, disregarding the specified start
  index, but assuming 0 instead.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.41:

* Improved performance of whitespace(Writer,char[],int,int): Checking the
  characters first and then writing the complete character string at once.

* Added XMLChecker class for checking various symbols in the XML grammar.

* XMLOutputter.dtd(String,String,String) now properly checks that the 'name'
  argument matches the 'Name' production in the XML grammar.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.40:

* Improved functionality of build file. May have some bugs still.
  Based on XINS build.xml file, see http://xins.sf.net/.

* Changed some directory locations. All XSLT files are now under src/xslt and
  all CSS files are now under src/css.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.39:

* Removed deprecated classes XMLOutputterStates and SAXOutputter.

* Removed deprecated class function getVersion() from class XMLOutputter.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.38:

* Invalid whitespace is now properly treated as an error. This will cause an
  InvalidXMLException.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.37:

* Checking invalid XML characters 0-8, 11, 12 and 14-31. Throwing an
  InvalidXMLException if any of these is found.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.36:

* Using Java2HTML 1.3.1.

* Fixed erroneous @link.

______________________________________________________________________________

  implement pretty printing:
  - Made class XMLEncoder public again.
  - Added LineBreak class.
  - XMLOutputter now supports pretty printing by having a reference to a
    LineBreak to use and a reference to an indentation character string.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.34:

* Improved the documentation of XMLOutputter, XMLEventListener and
  XMLEventListenerStates.

* Added a test for XMLOutputter.endDocument().

* Fixed some Checkstyle warning.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.32:

* Fixed a bug in XMLOutputter.setState() that was triggered when the new state

* XMLOutputter.endDocument() now flushes the underlying Writer.

* Tightened state checking in XMLOutputter.

* Improved documentation for XMLOutputter and XMLEventListener.

* Introduced Library class and marked XMLOutputter.getVersion() deprecated.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.29:

* SAX support added by means of new class:
  org.znerd.xmlenc.sax.SAXOutputter

* Added methods pcdata(char[],int,int) and whitespace(char[],int,int) to the
  XMLOutputter class.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.28:

* Switched from Checkstyle 2.x to Checkstyle 3.

* Added method getElementStackCapacity() and setElementStackCapacity(int).

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.27:

* Strings are no longer trimmed anywhere. This changes the behaviour of the
  dtd(String,String,String) and pi(String,String) methods.

* Encodings are printed as they are, they are not converted to upper case.

* The encoding 'ASCII' is recognized as an alias of 'US-ASCII'.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.26:

* XMLOutputter.close() can now only be called when the state is either
  START_TAG_OPEN or WITHIN_ELEMENT.

* Sticking all source files in the tar.gz distribution files.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.25:

* Removed entityRef(String). Was deprecated in 0.24.

* Trying to recover from OutOfMemoryErrors.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.24:

* Added method setEscaping(boolean) to XMLOutputter. Deprecated
  entityRef(String).

* Removed init(Writer,String), setState(XMLOutputter.State) and getDepth()
  and XMLOutputterStates.INITIAL_STATE. All were deprecated.

* Added method getVersion() to XMLOutputter. It returns the version of the
  xmlenc library.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.23:

* Added constructor XMLOutputter(Writer,encoding).

* Added reset(Writer,encoding). Deprecated init(Writer,encoding).

* Removed stag(String), etag() and all getInstance() methods.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XMLENC 0.22:

* Small performance improvement in init(Writer,String) and reset() methods.
  Instead of creating a java.util.Stack instance (to contain the open
  elements), the clear() method is called on the existing Stack instance. Also
  made the field final. This could improve the performance slightly as well.

* Removed unused state VOID_WITHIN_ELEMENT.

* Allowing empty CDATA sections and empty comments.

* Internally using a String array instead of a Stack to keep track of the open
  elements. This should improve performance.

* Added method: String[] getElementStack().

* Added method getElementStackSize() as a replacement for getDepth().
  Deprecated getDepth().

* Added setState(State,String[]) and deprecated setState(State).
